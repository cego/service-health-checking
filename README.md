# Service Health Checking

This package contains core functionality for HTTP health checking of Laravel services.

## Usage
When the package is installed, a health endpoint, `/vendor/service-health-checking` is exposed. The endpoint
returns either `200 OK` if all the overall status is `pass` or `warning`, or `500 Internal Server Error` if one or more 
check fails. If a check fails the response payload lists the error messages generated by the health checks.

## Creating health checks
To create a health check for your service, simply create a class that extends
`\Cego\ServiceHealthChecking\BaseHealthCheck`. The base method has 2 abstract emthods:
1. `check(): HealthStatus` should perform the check and return a `HealthStatus` object.
2. `getDescription(): string` should return a description of the health check. 

## Registering health checks
The package will publish a config file, `service-health-checking.php`, in which you must register the health
check classes, in order for them to run. 

The package is shipped with a basic database connection check.
