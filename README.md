# Service Health Checking

This package contains core functionality for HTTP health checking of Laravel services.

## Usage
When the package is installed, a health endpoint, `/vendor/service-health-checking/check` is exposed. The endpoint
returns either `200 OK` if all checks pass, or `500 Internal Server Error` if one or more check fails. If a check fails
the response payload lists the error messages generated by the health checks.

## Creating health checks
To create a health check for your service, simply create a class that implements the 
`Cego\ServiceHealthChecking\Interfaces\HealthCheck` interface. The interface require 2 methods:
1. `check(): bool` should perform the check and return `true` on success and `false`
2. `getErrorMessage(): string` should return an error message that explained what went wrong

## Registering health checks
The package will publish a config file, `service-health-checking.php`, in which you must register the health
check classes, in order for them to run. 

The package is shipped with a basic database connection check.
